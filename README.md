#### Executive Summary
In this paper, we use knowledge graph (KG) to study systemic risk in the banking industry. KG provides a graphic representation of the connections of entities of interest (known as vertices or nodes) with the strengths of connections being reflected by the lines connecting them (known as edges) or distances between them. As a result, KG is a natural tool for visualizing the relationships among financial institutions. Furthermore, various data and graph choices can present how differently entities of interest can be connected. In this paper, we draw KGs on two datasets: liquidity index and volatility and three different embedding methods: locally linear embedding, spectral embedding and principal component analysis. Our empirical results show, not surprisingly, that volatility and liquidity index are not similar in explaining how banks are connected. Embedding methods also matter.
