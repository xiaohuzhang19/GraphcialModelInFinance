76, who has worked since 1999 as a senior energy analyst at weeden &amp; co, who correctly predicted the recent price spike and sees an eventual move to around $300 a barrel. oil on an upward slope he said he sees oil on an upward slope. \"i thought the peak on this cycle might be somewhere around $100 a barrel, but it turned out to be a lot higher, more than $145 in early july. he said, \"i would put the price of oil today at somewhere between $75 and $115 ... however, it is perception that really is changing, not the true value of oil throughout the system .. we are not going to have enough oil, and we are going to have to start a huge switch in which we make do with a number of other fuels that are not so easy to convert to our immediate energy needs, mainly for transportation. reasons for a higher oil price among reasons for a higher oil price charles maxwell saw rising resource nationalism,, political instability and constraints on refining, which is probably one of the easier constraints to solve. mr maxwell expects gas should last another 40 or 50 years before it runs into the same problems of peaking that there are now in oil. it doesn't currently meet the major requirement of oil supply, particularly for transportation uses. predicts oil at $300 a barrel mr maxwell added, \"we will see $300 a barrel, or roughly $250 in today's dollars, because oil supply will be so short. if you want that oil, that's what you will have to pay for it. that will be in 2015 after the peak of oil. but even earlier, around 2010, more than 50 pct of the non-opec world will have peaked in its production of oil so the dependence on opec will become extreme. that will give opec a chance, i'm afraid, to lift prices rather more quickly on us than they are doing today. mr maxwell said the tar sands, particularly those in western canada will be one area where the oil industry will continue. he sees encana at $112 vs around $67 recently and suncor at $90 vs about $50 last week, but it may take 3 or 4 years to get to that level. new opportunities in new technologies he added, \"there are going to be so many new companies and so many new technologies .. there are going to be a lot of new industries coming in and wonderful opportunities in the stock market. but the old names in energy that i've covered for years won't be what they were. harsh future for oil companies, all societies most of the oil companies will be swallowed up by the larger ones. then the larger ones will be broken up into trusts or new corporations. i don't think the oil industry can go on as it is now\"... there are going to be thousands of new adjustments leading to new investment opportunities. but the adjustment to that rising oil price, which could take as long as 20 years, will be a very harsh social experience .. for every society\". in other news *silver state bank was the latest in a series of bank failures in the us. sen john mccain's son andrew mccain until

august 22, 2008 3m is star of the week as it prices through cds length: 982 words only $2.45bn of new a grade debt was sold in the us corporate bond market this week as equities were pummelled, concern mounted over the fate of the government sponsored enterprises, and the market began to pack away its pencils for labor day. the star of the week was a deal for 3m. the diversified technology company sold an$850m five year bond at 135bp over treasuries on monday via citigroup and goldman sachs. it is a rare name and one rated double-a, so in this environment it was received by grateful investors like manna from heaven. \"it's rated aa1/aa, it's a museum piece, and the deal could be upsized,\" said one of the co-managers at the close yesterday (thursday). very few deals from any borrower have been priced as narrowly as 135bp over treasuries lately. moreover, the deal incorporated a positive basis to cds. 3m's five year default price was around 43bp, while the asset swap price of the bonds was about libor plus 31bp (five year swaps were a whopping 104bp/105bp at the time) so there was a positive basis of around 12bp. the only other borrower to sell bonds at a positive basis to cds in recent times was berkshire hathaway, which priced a $1bn five year deal at 168bp over treasuries on 30 july. \"it came at 10bp through cds, and one thing that this deal showed is that there is a certain group of investors that are prepared to bid aggressively for top quality industrials,\" said a senior syndicate banker at one of the lead managers. the borrower normally offers only one deal a year, though in 2007 it sold three bonds worth $2.5bn.its last visit to the bond market was in december 2007, when it sold a five year at 113bp over treasuries. that bond carried a yield of 4.65%, yet the bond sold this week came in at 4.375%. not only is the spread only 22bp wider than in december - hardly worth acknowledging in this environment - the cost of funds on a yield basis is less. \"their cost of funds has gone down,\" said the syndicate official. \"most industrial treasurers aren't concerned with spreads as much as rates.\" by the end of the week, the bond had narrowed to 125bp/130bp, but very, very few bonds were changing hands by this stage. \"that one's in bond heaven,\" said a new york dealer. reliable names pull in orders duke energy indiana kicked off the week with a$500m 30 year bond at 193bp over treasuries. the underwriters were deutsche bank, merrill lynch and ubs. this was another well received transaction, and, like the 3m trade, represented a defensive deal in uncertain markets. \"utilities have been a consistent presence with well-received deals lately,\" said a senior syndicate official. initial whispers of treasuries plus the low 190s were heard for the transaction, which was then revised to plus 190bp-195bp. it was priced at the wider end of guidance, and at the time the price of plus 193bp was reckoned to represent a new issue concession of around 22bp-23bp. the deal was around 1.5 times oversubscribed. after that, only a$350m two year floating rate note from john deere capital and a$750m five year issue from bank of new york mellon hit the market. the bank of new york deal, underwritten by bank of america securities and morgan stanley, was announced as a mere$300m trade, but when the official guidance of plus 220bp-225bp was released it had grown to a$750m trade. it was priced at the tight end of guidance, at treasuries plus 220bp. the bank is a processing institution, free from the unwise investments that have so tainted most new york financial names over the last year, said dealers close to the transaction. \"it is a safe haven bank,\" said one of the co-managers. \"the book grew quickly and we were able to price at the tight end of spreads.\" others were less confident in the virtues of the trade. they said that with citigroup printing at 337.5bp the previous week, this trade offered little value. \"why does someone buy this? where do you find the relative value?\" asked one. dealers agreed that the trade benefitted from its size. had the borrower tried to sell $2,bn it would have had to price the trade closer to treasuries plus 300bp, they suggested. the fact that the bond offering was suddenly increased from$300m to$700m indicated that the lead managers were nervous about how much they could price, suggested rival bankers. they added that the trade was assisted by a hefty reverse inquiry. \"i think one or two big investors moved the needle on that trade,\" said one. on the previous day, john deere capital sold two year floaters at libor plus 50bp, but upped the deal from an original$250m to$350.m the leads were jp morgan and merrill lynch. new issues to be hard labor the prospect of much debt being issued next week before labor day is now small. this is traditionally one of the quietest weeks of the year, and, in the current environment, the chances of that particular trend being bucked are very small. over $70bn was sold in august 2007, of which $7.5bn was priced in the week before labor day, but it is unlikely that this will repeated. what is particularly worrying for the market is that many of the deals that were priced at historically wide levels in the high grade market last week have not performed particularly well in the secondary

depression - but nothing in recent memory, not even the collapse of the hedge fund ltcm 10 years ago, comes close to the drama and crisis that the us financial system is going through. in case you haven't been paying attention, here's what's happening. lehman brothers, one of the largest and oldest us investment banks, is going bust, barring an unlikely last-minute government bailout. merrill lynch, for years one of the titans of wall street, hocked itself in a firesale to a rival, bank of america. and aig, one of the world's largest insurance firms, is begging for a $40bn emergency loan from the us government to stave off its own destruction. in the words of the wall street journal: \"the american financial system was shaken to its core\". and that was just on sunday. it doesn't pay to take the weekend off on wall street these days ? it was just last sunday that the us treasury confirmed it was taking control of fannie mae and freddie mac ? the vast american mortgage agencies ? at a cost to the taxpayer estimated to eventually range between zero dollars and a few hundred billion. and as the minutes ticked over from sunday to monday on the us east coast, lehman brothers finally threw in its towel and filed for bankruptcy. in one way or another it will be the end for a bank that started in alabama back in 1844 ? a sticky end considering that last year it had sales of $57bn and only a few months ago was named by business week magazine in its 50 top performing companies for 2008. (business week's citation, in hindsight, looks wise: \"still, the firm is highly leveraged. the final throes of the global credit contraction will test just how good it really is.\" now we know.) what links all these once-buoyant institutions? all of them ? from fannie mae to aig ? have been caught up in the bonfire of the vanities that was the us housing market, the same underlying cause that six months ago saw the combined forces of wall street and washington rush to prop up and then dismember another former investment banking stalwart, bear stearns. as the housing market turned toxic, so the loans that bear stearns, lehman brothers, fannie mae et al, had cheerfully advanced, bought up, repackaged and insured, lost value. the federal reserve, abetted by the us treasury, pumped cash into the financial markets to prevent them seizing up. but their efforts were hampered by the very financial instruments that the masters of wall street had invented. the blizzard of options and derivatives the banks have used in recent years are byzantine in their complexity, making it very difficult to value the potential losses on the books. that's why the emergence of aig may be the most troubling event of wall street's bloody sunday. while the fall of lehman brothers was no surprise ? in recent weeks the bank has desperately tried to raise fresh capital and sell its most profitable arms ? aig is in a different league as (until recently) one of the largest financial institutions in the world of any type. it has (or it did have) a trillion dollars worth of assets. but despite all that, it too is suffering from the shaky mortgages it holds, as well as the mortgage insurance contracts it has underwritten. now it needs to borrow money on the financial markets on anything other than punitive terms ? and this is the root cause of its problem. to raise funds aig needs to show potential lenders what its assets are ? and so is forced to put price tags on the swamp of mortgages and derivatives it is holding. as the new york times reports, aig has been valuing its mortgage junk bonds at far higher than the likes of lehman brothers, and so the hole in its accounts is bigger than expected. if that's the case at aig and lehman brothers, then the existential question facing wall street this morning ? as it has on so many recent mornings ? is how do you put a value on something that no one wants to buy? you can wait, and hope that something (a housing market recovery?) turns up. you can hope the government gets you out of the jam. but otherwise: when no one wants to buy something, its value diminishes towards nought. and until that problem is solved, next sunday could be just as exciting as the last two. but we won't even have to wait that long: today is shaping up to be hectic as well, with credit rating agencies poised to downgrade aig, and stock markets around the world opening to the sound of \"sell\" orders whizzing through the ethernet. load-date: september 15, 2008 language: english publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 guardian unlimited (\u00a9 guardian newspapers limited) all rights reserved 964 of 2537","the new york post september 15, 2008 monday 'doomed' lehman now bros. grim - declares bankruptcy after feds balk at bailout","american banker september 16, 2008 tuesday stocks take pounding on merrill, lehman moves","el paso times (texas) september 15, 2008 monday in brief: securities and exchange commission plans steps against short-selling","st. paul pioneer press (minnesota) september 15, 2008 monday local financial players mostly unscathed by market turmoil","variety september 1, 2008 - september 7, 2008 length: 347 words new york the road was about even in week 13 (aug. 18-24), bringing the total gross for the 12-show slate to $10,574,826. big winners for the sesh included the ottawa production of \"wicked,\" which continued to climb to $1,449,160, breaking the house record, and the long-awaited kennedy center production of \"the lion king,\" which raked in $1,549,300, making it the highest-grossing show of the week. chicago jersey boys (m-3rd co.) bank of america theater ($105; 1,848; $1,243,600) (10/06/07-oe). pw, $1,089,685. last (47th) wk, $951,467. wicked (m-2nd co.) ford center ($82; 2,243, $1,224,272) (6/24/05-oe). pw, $1,144,257. last (166th) wk, $1,012,690. los angeles wicked (m-3rd co.) pantages theater ($85; 2,703, $1,633,691) (2/10/07-oe). pw, $1,340,586. last (81st) wk, $1,314,959. ottawa jersey boys (m-1st co.) toronto center for the performing arts ($200; 7,766; $715,235/$747c,420) (8/18/08-8/24/08). pw, $1,285,443 in dallas. last (1st) wk, $523,833/$547c,405. wicked (m-1st co.) national arts center ($94; 2,245, $1,491,595can) (8/13-8/31/08). pw, $1,370,839/$1c,417,310. last (2nd) wk, $1c,498,286/$1,449,160. philadelphia monty python's spamalot (m) academy of music ($87; 2,716; $1,276,280) (8/12/08-8/17/08). pw, $636,109. last (2nd) wk, $662,560. portland, ore. the phantom of the opera (m) keller auditorium ($76; 2,959; $1,119,020) (8/13/08-9/10/08). pw, $927,430. last (2nd) wk, $916,414. san diego a chorus line (m-3rd co.) civic center ($71; 2,882; $729,052) (8/12/08-8/17/08). pw, $612,148. last (2nd) wk, $874,105. seattle shrek (m) 5th avenue ($78; 2,107; $891,873) (8/14/08-9/21/08). pw, $758,464, 6 perf. last (2nd) wk, 6 perf, $756,829. tampa, fla. mamma mia!

'it catapults bank of america into positions of strength in three businesses where they were weak,' said james ellman, portfolio manager at hedge fund seacliff capital. 'now bank of america has one of the best and largest retail brokerages in the country, one of the top investment banks in the world, and a large stake in one of the best investment managers in the world,' ellman said. bank of america agreed to pay 0.8595 shares of bank of america common stock for each merrill lynch share. the price is 1.8 times stated tangible book value. the bank is buying about usd 44 billion of merrill's common shares, as well as dollar 6 billion of options, convertibles, and restricted stock units. bank of america said it expects to achieve usd 7 billion in pretax expense savings, fully realized by 2012, and expects the deal to be accretive to earnings by 2010. the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. the price, which comes to about usd 29 per share, represents a 70 percent premium to merrill's share price on friday, although merrill's shares were trading at usd 50 in may and over usd 90 at the beginning of january 2007. the deal has been approved by directors of both companies. three merrill directors will join the bank of america board. stuck with some of the same toxic debt -- much of it mortgage-related -- that torpedoed lehman's balance sheet, merrill has been hit hard by the credit crisis and has written down more than usd 40 billion over the last year. copyright: thomson financial load-date: september 17,

considers buyout length: 644 words shell-shocked morgan stanley employees arrived at the bank's new york headquarters this morning to hear a company-wide pep talk from the chief executive, john mack, as doubts mounted over the firm's future as an independent entity. after a 24% dive in the bank's share price on wednesday, mack was due to address his 48,000 staff through an online \"town hall meeting\". in the first few minutes of trading on the new york stock exchange today, the bank's stock slid by a further 7%. as confidence wanes in the traditional wall street \"broker-dealer\" banking model, morgan stanley is under pressure to follow merrill lynch by pulling off a merger with a high-street bank. sensing an opportunity, the north carolina-based group wachovia has approached morgan stanley and begun preliminary talks over a tie-up. mack, who is casting around for options, reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade its larger rival citigroup to consider a merger. according to the new york times, mack told the citigroup chief executive, vikram pandit: \"we need a merger partner or we're not going to make it.\" pandit was unmoved by the appeal, the paper reported, and china's citic securities has denied rumours that it is in talks with morgan stanley. outside morgan stanley's offices near times square, employees acknowledged that times were rocky. \"yep,\" said one banker, when asked whether he was worried. \"the stock's gone down a lot.\" a female employee was more demure, saying she would wait for mack's remarks. \"he doesn't seem to be worried. he thinks we're doing well,\" she said. at the beginning of the year, wall street's big five standalone broker-dealer investment banks were bear stearns, lehman brothers, merrill lynch, morgan stanley and goldman sachs. only the last two remain independent and, although they both produced figures this week showing that they were profitable, they are struggling to persuade investors that their business model offers sufficient access to capital. analysts say panic is setting in. in a research note, citigroup's chief us equity strategist, tobias levkovich, wrote: \"fear seems to be overtaking any rational discourse, with the credit crunch slipping into crisis proportions and the desire to be in cash overwhelming any willingness to remain invested in equities.\" the index of market volatility, known as vix, is at its highest level since 2002. levkovich said that after a 25% fall from their peak, stocks were down by more than the average slump for an entire recession. \"our sense is that this week's sell-off is reflective of a cathartic capitulation,\" he wrote. as people search for safe havens to put their money, the price of gold has been rocketing and government bonds are at a record high. at one point this week, investors were paying more for one-month treasury bonds than they could expect to get on maturity - in other words, they were paying the government to borrow their money. during early trading in new york, central banks' coordinated global effort to pump liquidity into the financial system appeared to improve sentiment. the dow jones industrial average opened higher, rallying by 80 points in the first few minutes of trading. shares in the troubled washington mutual jumped by 7% on hopes that the troubled seattle-based savings and loans bank could soon be sold. its biggest shareholder, the private equity firm texas pacific, has allowed an auction to go ahead by waving a $1.5bn payment it was due if the bank is sold. in a statement, texas pacific said: \"our goal is to maximise the bank's flexbility in this difficult market environment.\" wamu, which has 2,200 branches across the us, has called in goldman sachs to find a buyer. there has been speculation that hsbc could be interested. others mentioned include jp morgan, bank of america and wells fargo. citigroup was distancing itself from any deal today. load-date: september 18,

trading days experienced by wall street in a generation, the latest list of america's top 400 richest people produced by the business magazine forbes looks like a window into a bygone world. the microsoft chairman, bill gates, still tops the list with a net worth of$57bn (?31.7bn). but how safe is the second-place position of the famous investor warren buffett - his $50bn fortune has dropped $12bn in six months - since the list was compiled at close of play on august 29? since then the dow jones has dropped more than 800 points in just four days, lehman brothers became the world's largest ever bankrupt, merrill lynch was forced into a shotgun wedding with bank of america, aig was bailed out by the us government and morgan stanley is on the brink of collapse. aig's woes earlier in the year had already pushed one of the insurance group's major shareholders, eli broad, down to no 48 on the list with an estimated wealth of $6.7bn. a well-known philanthropist, he sold his sunamerica business to aig and the proceeds have helped not only his adoptive city of los angeles but the nation's art dealers. he owns the world's largest collection of works by jeff koons and once bought a painting by roy lichtenstein for $2.5m using a credit card. the government bailout of aig, however, will have significantly hit his wallet since the forbes 400 list was compiled. it is unlikely that art will retain its value in the current slump, despite the record-breaking damien hirst sale earlier this week. this will come as a shock to donald and doris fisher, the founders of the gap clothing chain who returned to the list in joint 377th place - on $1.3bn - thanks to their $1bn art collection which includes pieces by chuck close, richard serra and alexander calder. the couple share their spot with the former citigroup boss sandy weill, who can also expect the recent turmoil to have hit the value of the shares in the bank he still owns - he had already lost$500m over the year to the end of august. the position of fellow citigroup shareholder gerald ford - who sold golden state bankcorp in 2002 for $6bn to the bank, and is listed at no 355 with $1.4bn - also looks rocky. back among the big hitters, wall street's crash and the demise of lehman brothers will have hit the $15bn fortune of 15th-placed abigail johnson. her family runs fidelity investments, which is understood to have funds with some of the highest exposure to both the collapsed investment bank and aig. her father edward is placed at no 28 with $11bn and is level-pegging with george soros. soros ranks highest among those in the fortune 400 whose wealth comes from hedge funds and private equity and it is unlikely that all the other 23 in the list who have made their money the same way will be there in a year's time. the bridgewater associates boss, ray dalio, is ranked at no 78 with a fortune estimated at $4.5bn, while the och-ziff hedge fund co-founder daniel och is at no 95 on $3.9bn. also at no 78 is john paulson, who has made millions for his funds over the past year by betting against sub-prime assets. the firm's credit opportunities fund was up 590% net of fees last year. as well as wiping out billions in paper fortunes as share prices collapse, and perhaps raising billions more for shrewd investors, the impact of the turmoil in the banking sector is likely to hit other industries. particularly vulnerable is michael bloomberg, who sits in eighth position with a $20bn fortune. the collapses and mergers in the financial industry are likely to significantly reduce demand for the news and trading terminals that bear his name. elsewhere, google's sergey brin and larry page come in at 13 and 14 with$15.9bn and $15.8bn respectively. lawrence 'larry' ellison, the boss of the software company oracle, comes in third at $27,bn while spaces four, five and six are taken up with the wal-mart dynasty who together control more than 39% of the grocery chain, which owns asda in the uk. jim walton, the son of the supermarket giant's pioneer sam walton, comes in fourth at $23.4bn; his elder brother and the company's chairman, robson walton is in fifth on $23.3bn, and their sister alice is joint sixth with $23.2bn with the widow of her other brother john, christy walton, and her family. finally, the facebook founder mark zuckerberg can afford a wry smile. he is the youngest member of the forbes 400 thanks to the $15bn valuation placed on the social networking site when microsoft took its 1.6% stake last year. his$1.5bn fortune puts him at number 321. at the time he was being pushed to float the business, which he set up four years ago. if he had, it would now be buffeted by the current market turmoil and it is unlikely he would have the minimum $1.3bn fortune needed for inclusion. load-date: september 19, 2008 language: english publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 guardian unlimited (\u00a9 guardian newspapers limited) all rights reserved 586 of

- israel's business arena september 22, 2008 monday wall street investment bank declared extinct; morgan stanley and goldman sachs, the last of the breed, have become regulated banks. length: 394 words the us federal reserve board has approved the applications requests of the two remaining investment banks on wall street, goldman sachs and moran stanley, to become commercial banks. the object is to bring about an improvement in the liquidity of the two banks, in view of the collapse in the value of their investments. the move qualifies the two banks for direct access to loans from the central bank, which will help to prop up their liquidity. morgan stanley and goldman sachs will now take upon themselves the restrictions and regulatory framework of other commercial banks in the us. the past week has seen the collapse of investment bank lehman brothers, and the sale of merrill lynch to bank of america for $50 billion. morgan stanley has been in talks with wachovia corp. over a takeover, after acknowledging that it would find it difficult to meet its commitments. from this point of view, the important difference between investment banks and commercial banks is that the latter can take deposits from retail customers rather than relying on borrowing from other banks as investment banks do, a model that leaves them vulnerable. goldman sachs chairman and ceo said lloyd blankfein said, \"when goldman sachs was a private partnership, we made the decision to become a public company, recognizing the need for permanent capital to meet the demands of scale. while accelerated by market sentiment, our decision to be regulated by the federal reserve is based on the recognition that such regulation provides its members with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and funding. \"we believe that goldman sachs, under federal reserve supervision, will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources.\" because of concerns about their liquidity, the share prices of morgan stanley and goldman sachs have fallen sharply over the past week, morgan stanley's by 27% and goldman sachs' by 16%. according to bloomberg, morgan stanley has written off $15.7 billion in the current financial crisis and goldman sachs about $4.9 billion, and while the two banks have remained profitable, their revenue has been in decline. published by globes [online], israel business news - www.globes.co.il - on september 22, 2008 \u00a9 copyright of globes publisher itonut

kolkata, india; and ho chi minh city, vietnam. client firms have expanded their networks of service bases. u.s. financial conglomerate citigroup inc. deals with customers via outsourcing services in 40 countries/regions around the world, while u.s. computer maker hewlett-packard co. uses such services in 170 countries/regions. some companies are searching for lower-cost locations such as sub-saharan african countries. another notable industry trend is that value-added outsourcing services are becoming increasingly available. call centers, which at first handled simple work such as responding to consumer inquiries and complaints about goods or services, have moved up to offer higher-level functions including sales promotions. indian providers, meanwhile, are shifting their emphasis to advanced services called knowledge process outsourcing, such as services related to developing new drugs and designing aircraft. the global market for overseas outsourcing services is expected to reach about $130 billion by 2010, according to an estimate by the business processing association of the philippines.

a time in the chip industry worldwide. samsung electronics is negotiating for the purchase of sandisk, a u.s. flash memory-card company, while micron is looking to acquire qimonda. the reasons why this consolidation is gaining momentum are manifold ranging from price collapses from the forecast of a downturn after the beijing olympics to leading chipmakers production that has created a glut on the market. with these unfavorable factors, prices of ddr2 1gb dynamic random access memory (dram) chips have nose dived over 28 percent in a month to record lows, according to market research firms. in line with the gloomy future of the market, many institutional investors have issued bearish forecasts and slashed investment ratings on dram and even profitable nand stocks. the current oversupply began in 2007. a drown-out market downturn hits smaller, pure-play dram makers hardest, and the position of smaller chipmakers is particularly limiting. analysts say it is \"crucial\" for some chipmakers to either close their chip lines or to push their products by taking sliding profits. as a last card to survive in such a gloomy situation, samsung electronics has been in possible merger talks with the world's biggest flash card memory manufacturer sandisk, while the world's no. 3 dram maker micron technology is seriously considering buying german-based qimonda. meanwhile, the world's no. 2 hynix semiconductor finalized its acquisition of an 8.6 percent stake in its taiwan-based strategic partner, promos technology. \"rock-bottom dram prices are cornering smaller dram makers,\" market research firm isuppli said, forecasting the average dram contract price to decline by more than 10 percent from the current level by the end of the third quarter. \"backed by spending cuts by followers such as powerchip, nanya and inotera, the industry's average profit margin will be back to a break even point,\" kim nam-hyung, chief analyst for memory at isuppli wrote in a report to clients. analysts say samsung and hynix are at least maintaining production in anticipation of the next upturn in dram prices, however, doing so could add to the length of the current downturn, which could be weighed down further by the currently decreasing demand for pcs and notebooks in the coming quarters. although it seems \"natural\" for smaller chipmakers to continuously cut their capacity, that measure leaves them vulnerable to market share losses whenever a recovery does happen _ especially with samsung and hynix keeping up the pressure, they add. \"cash burns at some manufacturers are at an alarming rate,\" glen yeung, an analyst at citigroup, wrote in a note. industry watchers emphasized that the global dram industry had gone through eight major business cycles since the 1990s, narrowing down the major players in the field to eight. the on-going downturn, they said, will spur regrouping. financial times deutschland of germany recently reported that qimonda's parent company, infineon technologies, was planning to sell its ownership of the dram-making subsidiary when the market was weak. leading dram makers including micron technology and elpida are potential buyers, industry watchers say. \"the global map of dram manufacturing will likely change once qimonda is sold,\" a samsung electronics executive told the korea times. \"if micron acquires qimonda by forming an alliance with nanya and inotera, it will pose a serious challenge to samsung and hynix,\" he said. taiwan's nanya has just entered into cooperation with micron on next-generation dram technology after a partnership with qimonda ended and the two companies are organizing a new venture. \"well, i don't think any of the dram makers will shut down their business in the near future. but they are faced with a transition period,\" the samsung executive said. load-date: september 9, 2008 language: english publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 the korea times all rights reserved 12 of 632","the new york post september 9, 2008 tuesday bofa on deck with yankees","star tribune (minneapolis, mn) september 7, 2008 sunday metro edition heard on the prairie;

words a more positive take on the competitive threat facing computer games retailer game group has come from analysts at royal bank of scotland. apart from dismissing this week's price promotion from wm morrison, rbs also repeats its suggestion that game could be a bid target for us rival gamestop. rbs said: \"game group's shares were hit hard, following morrisons' decision to launch a one-off promotion on video games this week, offering top 20 chart titles at half price. clearly, this brought back unhappy memories of the argos price promotions of 2002, which resulted in dixons following suit, significantly hitting game group's like-for-likes and margins. \"however, there are significant differences. morrisons has a 0% share of the games market, so a one week promotion is in itself going to be immaterial for game (its market share this week would still probably be less than 1%). no other supermarkets or retailers have followed suit. and morrisons' stocks and range are extremely limited. there has been no impact on game thus far, and given its significant preowned trade, it is more insulated from price discounting elsewhere. assuming no follow-through from other retailers, we would not expect any impact on numbers. \"interestingly, gamestop's chief executive recently stepped down, but he remains as chairman, with responsibility for acquisition opportunities and international expansion ? the only two obvious large-scale acquisitions would be micromania in france, and game in the uk (one of the few major international markets in which gamestop is absent). we expect strong results on september 30, which should help rebuild confidence.\" perhaps this helps explain why game - to judge by readers' comments - seems to have been in no hurry to price-match the morrisons' discounts. in any case game shares, which have fallen sharply over the past couple of days, is now 2.75p better at 223.25p. turning to the overall market, the mood has been dampened by fairly gloomy comments from some members of the bank of england's monetary policy committee - notably david blanchflower - at a select committee hearing. so the ftse 100 is currently nursing a 45.6 point fall to 5320.6. apart from the retail fallers, pharmaceuticals group astrazeneca is 96p lower at ?25.46 after a sell note from goldman sachs. the bank, which also cut its price target from ?26.78 to ?25, said the shares had risen too high in recent months to be supported by the outlook for the business. \"we believe astrazeneca is likely to underperform its peers as the market recovers and investors begin to assess the significant strategic longer-term challenges facing the company.\" load-date: september 11, 2008 language: english publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 guardian

part of a wide-ranging effort to contain wall street's worst financial crisis since the great depression, the securities and exchange commission took the unprecedented step friday of banning short sales of stock in 799 financial companies. what follows are questions and answers about the government's decision: q. what is short-selling? a. the activities of short-selling might sound lewd at times -- there's naked shorting and covering your shorts -- but the practice of selling stock short is pretty straightforward. investors sell short if they think the shares of a particular company are going to decline and they want to profit from the drop (see graphic on a10). to do this, an investor borrows shares of company x, usually from their broker, and then immediately sells them at their market price, say $100 per share. if the share price falls, let's say to $80, the investor buys back the shares and returns them to the broker. the investor pockets the difference -- in this case, $20 per share. the practice can be risky. if the shares increase in value, the investor has to buy them back at a higher price, losing money in the process. q. why did the sec temporarily ban the practice? a. the government and some money managers blame widespread short-selling by hedge funds for contributing to the collapse of lehman brothers holdings inc., american international group inc. and other troubled companies by driving down their share prices. shares of the two surviving investment banks, goldman sachs group inc. and morgan stanley, saw sharp price drops this week. on wednesday, morgan stanley shares fell 24.2 percent while goldman's dropped 13.9 percent. such sharp drops erode the market's confidence, which makes it harder for the companies to raise capital and could scare away clients, further weakening the companies. the sec's ban gives financial companies time to stabilize without the daily drumbeat of hedge funds shorting them on a coordinated basis, said phil orlando, chief equity market strategist for federated investors inc., which manages $330 billion in assets. new york attorney general andrew cuomo said friday his office will investigate whether some short sellers spread rumors and negative information to drive down the share prices of lehman, aig, goldman and other firms. q. what's naked shorting? a. naked shorting involves selling shares without actually borrowing them, a practice that critics say is particularly prone to abuse, because it potentially enables more shares to be sold into the market than actually exist. the sec temporarily banned naked shorting of 19 financial companies in july. on wednesday, it restricted the practice but did not ban it outright. some money managers have called for the sec to prohibit naked shorting. q. how much are short sellers really to blame for the mess we're in? a. that's a hotly disputed question. the sec said that in normal times shorts can make markets more efficient and bring in more capital, but added that a time out is needed. richard baker, president of the managed funds association, a trade group for hedge funds, said shorting is an essential risk management tool. q. will the sec's move work? a. on friday, it certainly helped reverse the slide in financial companies's shares, as goldman and morgan stanley each jumped about 20 percent. the hope is that by the time the ban is lifted, the rest of the government's rescue plan, which includes acquiring some of the toxic mortgage-related assets from large banks, will kick in and the market will stabilize on its own. but baker at the mfa argued that by the time this summer's temporary ban on naked shorting was lifted, the shares of the 19 covered companies had dropped anyway. load-date: september 20, 2008

picture of shrinking credits and weakening global economies, including china. (more detailed excerpts to follow first thing tomorrow). he quotes walter molano \"a brilliant economist with bcp securities) who expects the combined current account surplus of china, india, indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and thailand will shrink from a record $us419.4 billion in 2007 to $us376.2 billion in 2008 and just $us200.8 billion in 2009, numbers which dr faber says are too generous. for australia dr faber quotes albert edward, who expects an economic \"ice age\" with the s&amp;p 500 plummeting to 500 and government bonds' long term yields declining below 2 pct. \"at 500 for the s&amp;p for all practical purposes the system will be bankrupt, as income taxes will shrink and pension funds (state and private) will be unable to meet their liabilities\" he says. dr faber sees commodity exporters like australia and new zealand as weakening if there is a more significant slowdown in china, saying the $a has already collapsed by 13 pct and the australian stock market is down 27 pct while house and unit prices in nearly every city and country centre fell in august - the only previous times where house and land prices fell in all states australia moved into severe recessions, he quoted ceo of residex, john edwards as saying. 40c in every dollar flowing from europe to the oil rich countries returns in purchases, 10c for the us dr faber expects the housing bubble in the uk to be similarly affected. he added there was another dimension to the potential decline in the demand for commodities and their prices. \"according to bundesbank study, for every $1 that flows to the middle east or to russia for oil, the eurozone gets 40c back in the form of export orders.. the us on the other hand receives just 10c\". eco news *seasonally adjusted estimates for total

price of $645 million vs $702 million acquisition cost (net of depreciation, permanent booked impairments and other booked writedowns). the group continues to reduce its exposure to listed securities and has so far realised approximately $14 million of losses this financial year and expects to incur further losses, depending on market behavior, as the portfolio is further unwound. seven said given the volatility in markets it is practically impossible to reasonably forecast earnings for this current half ending december 2008 but it is likely that profit before tax including significant items will be approximately 40/50 pct below the prior corresponding period based on losses on the portfolio of $14 million as well as the weakness in advertising markets and the previously advised impact o profits from the acquisitions of unwired and engin, whose earnings are now consolidated in the seven group. the company hopes that market volatility will have reduced by the time of the agm on

indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and thailand will shrink from a record $us419.4 billion in 2007 to $us376.2 billion in 2008 and just $us200.8 billion in 2009, numbers which dr faber says are too

for the s&amp;p for all practical purposes the system will be bankrupt, as income taxes will shrink and pension funds (state and private) will be unable to meet their liabilities\" he says. dr faber

(more detailed excerpts to follow first thing tomorrow). he quotes walter molano \"a brilliant economist with bcp securities) who expects the combined current account surplus of china, india, indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and thailand will shrink from a record $us419.4 billion in 2007 to $us376.2 billion in 2008 and just $us200.8 billion in 2009, numbers which dr faber says are too generous. for australia dr faber quotes albert edward, who expects an economic \"ice age\" with the s&amp;p 500 plummeting to 500 and government bonds' long term yields declining below 2 pct. \"at 500 for the s&amp;p for all practical purposes the system will be bankrupt, as income taxes will shrink and pension funds (state and private) will be unable to meet their liabilities\" he says. dr faber sees commodity exporters like australia and new zealand as weakening if there is a more significant slowdown in china, saying the $a has already collapsed by 13 pct and the australian stock market is down 27 pct while house and unit prices in nearly every city and country centre fell in august - the only previous times where house and land prices fell in all states australia moved into severe recessions, he quoted ceo of residex, john edwards as saying. 40c in every dollar flowing from europe to the oil rich countries returns in purchases, 10c for the us dr faber expects the housing bubble in the uk to be similarly affected. he added there was another dimension to the potential decline in the demand for commodities and their prices. \"according to bundesbank study, for every $1 that flows to the middle east or to russia for oil, the eurozone gets 40c back in the form of export orders.. the us on the other hand receives just 10c\". eco news *seasonally adjusted estimates for total

indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and thailand will shrink from a record $us419.4 billion in 2007 to $us376.2 billion in 2008 and just $us200.8 billion in 2009, numbers which dr faber says are too generous. for australia dr faber quotes albert edward, who expects an economic \"ice age\" with the s&amp;p 500 plummeting to 500 and government bonds' long term yields declining below 2 pct. \"at 500 for the s&amp;p for all practical purposes the system will be bankrupt, as income taxes will shrink and pension funds (state and private) will be unable to meet their liabilities\" he says. dr faber sees commodity exporters like australia and new zealand as weakening if there is a more significant slowdown in china, saying the $a has already collapsed by 13 pct and the australian stock market is down 27 pct while house and unit prices in nearly every city and country centre fell in august - the only previous times where house and land prices fell in all states australia moved into severe

in the uk to be similarly affected. he added there was another dimension to the potential decline in the demand for commodities and their prices. \"according to bundesbank study, for every $1 that

giving the bank a strong vote of confidence following the tumultuous wall street events of the past few weeks. analysts hailed the move by buffett - known as the sage of omaha - as a sign that some stability could be returning to the markets. ubs called it \"the ultimate stamp of approval\". buffett, the world's second-richest man, acted after goldman and morgan stanley changed their status from investment banks to more traditional banks, ending a wall street era. after the wild swings in shares over the past fortnight, news of his investment calmed the london stock market today. the ftse 100 was up just 2.8 points at 5138.9, sparking a late overnight rally on wall street. shares in goldman were expected to surge by at least 20% when new york trading resumed. wall street was expected to be boostede, with the dow jones industrial average tipped to jump by 128 points. buffett is widely admired for his astute, common sense approach to investment, and the annual meetings for his berkshire hathaway company in his hometown of omaha, nebraska, draw huge crowds. earlier this year, he toured europe looking for acquisition targets. until now, he had held off buying stakes in any of the financial companies hit by the credit crunch, instead favouring a deal for the chewing gum maker wrigley's. \"goldman sachs is an exceptional institution,\" buffett said yesterday, citing its \"unrivalled global franchise, a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance\". lloyd blankfein, the goldman's chairman and chief executive, said he viewed the deal as \"a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects\". goldman is also planning to raise $2.5bn in a public offering of shares, with the capital-raising plan coming as the us treasury secretary, henry paulson, visited washington to defend a planned $700bn bailout of wall street. in a separate move, the japanese financial powerhouse sumitomo mitsui was also reported to be planning a large investment in goldman sachs. earlier this week, morgan stanley raised around $8bn by selling a 20% stake to japan's largest commercial bank, mitsubishi ufj financial. both goldman and morgan stanley maintained that their businesses were sound in recent weeks even as lehman brothers went bankrupt and merrill lynch sought shelter by selling itself to bank of america for $50bn. goldman has remained profitable, although its earnings have taken a hit. however, the fear in the markets put both goldman and morgan stanley under pressure, regardless of any reassurances. berkshire hathaway will take preferred shares in return for the investment, and will have the right to buy a further $5bn in ordinary shares at $115 a share at any time over the next five years. analysts said the deal had been structured in such a way as to protect buffett's investment from being wiped out. tim ghriskey, the chief investment officer at solaris asset management in new york, said; \"it is certainly a vote of confidence in goldman and their new structure. any time warren buffett and berkshire hathaway step in and invest in something, everybody takes notice.\" under their new status, goldman and morgan stanley will have to reduce the amount they can borrow relative to capital ratios. they will be subject to greater regulation, but will also be able to borrow money from the federal reserve. anton schutz, a portfolio manager at mendon capital advisors in rochester, new york, said the government bailout for the financial sector meant it was a \"great time to be buying\". load-date: september 24, 2008 language: english publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 guardian unlimited (\u00a9 guardian newspapers limited) all rights reserved 761

interviewed felix zulauf, the founder of zulauf asset management and a long time member of barron's roundtable. dr zulauf currently is equity averse and prefers gold and government bonds. he said \"the leveraging up in this cycle is reversing, and we are now de-leveraging... when a huge system - that is, the global credit system dominated by the investment-bank giants that have been the major creators of credit in the last cycle - turns down, the fallout is going to be terrible. de-leveraging is a very painful process, and will run longer and deeper than anybody can imagine. i've been fearful of this... i can't understand economists talking about no recession or mild recession. this is the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. it's different than the 30s, but is the worst since then, and the consequences will be very, very painful for virtually everybody in our economies\". dr zulauf reiterated he expects a downturn in all markets. \"people are already talking about a glut of unsold homes in china\". he said, \"government debt is going to rise dramatically over the next five to ten years. government debt is at 300 pct of gdp in most industrialised countries, if you calculate correctly. that can increase to 400 pct and 500 pct, but at some point the government bond market will not take this without any consequences. that will lead to rising long term interest rates. but because the economy is not on solid footing yet, short term rates will stay low for a long time. so you will have a very steep yield curve for many, many years and this is bearish for bonds since their prices keep falling\". he said the us fed is doing its utmost, but this will always mean they are one step behind. in the short term, europe will fare a little worse than the us because it has been tightening fiscal policy, but he thinks it will do better over the medium term. he said, \"europe can finance itself, meaning it's not dependent on outside money. it runs a slight current-account surplus and net-net it is not indebted to the rest of the world. the us is indebted to the rest of the world' that's a major difference. also, eurozone households (collectively) run a financial surplus while us households have deficits\". he said emerging economies are getting hurt, with real estate prices in some emerging economies, from the baltic states to some asian countries, coming down. but these countries have a better situation from a very, very long term point of view because of demographics. they are much younger nations. they are much lower in their standard of living, they are going up the ladder and they are competitive\". dr zulauf expects the us economy to go flat for several years, with major fiscal programs from time to time, each one bigger than the last, to help the economy\". dr zulauf said first we have to go through a down cycle. when that is finished, \"those who grow the best in a world of stimuli will be those that have the highest growth potential, namely the emerging economies. and then we will see rising bond yields\". asked for investment advice dr zulauf said, \"in this environment, those who do not lose win. for the average guy, i'd say go into the most defensive position .. i'm holding a lot of government bonds on the long side. i suggest that american investors stick to shorter term treasuries with maturites of up to two years. if you have extra money left and want to be more aggressive, you can play the markets short term. there are going to be a lot of runs up and down in a declining market. .. if you are an optimist by nature and if you want to be long, the one area that you should look at is daily necessities, notably consumer staples. companies like procter &amp; gamble, general mills and maybe johnson &amp; johnson. those are the defensive names\". load-date: september 21, 2008 language: english document-type: equity markets; analysis publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 news bites pty ltd.

weeks, apologies) paints a fairly grim picture of shrinking credits and weakening global economies, including china. (more detailed excerpts to follow first thing tomorrow). he quotes walter molano \"a brilliant economist with bcp securities) who expects the combined current account surplus of china, india, indonesia, malaysia, the philippines and thailand will shrink from a record $us419.4 billion in 2007 to $us376.2 billion in 2008 and just $us200.8 billion in 2009, numbers which dr faber says are too generous. for australia dr faber quotes albert edward, who expects an economic \"ice age\" with the s&amp;p 500 plummeting to 500 and government bonds' long term yields declining below 2 pct. \"at 500 for the s&amp;p for all practical purposes the system will be bankrupt, as income taxes will shrink and pension funds (state and private) will be unable to meet their liabilities\" he says. dr faber sees commodity exporters like australia and new zealand as weakening if there is a more significant slowdown in china, saying the $a has already collapsed by 13 pct and the australian stock market is down 27 pct while house and unit prices in nearly every city and country centre fell in august - the only previous times where house and land prices fell in all states australia moved into severe recessions, he quoted ceo of residex, john edwards as saying. 40c in every dollar flowing from europe to the oil rich countries returns in purchases, 10c for the us dr faber expects the housing bubble in the uk to be similarly affected. he added there was another dimension to the potential decline in the demand for commodities and their prices. \"according to bundesbank study, for every $1 that flows to the middle east or to russia for oil, the eurozone gets 40c back in the form of export orders.. the us on the other hand receives just 10c\". eco news *seasonally adjusted estimates for total

price of $645 million vs $702 million acquisition cost (net of depreciation, permanent booked impairments and other booked writedowns). the group continues to reduce its exposure to listed securities and has so far realised approximately $14 million of losses this financial year and expects to incur further losses, depending on market behavior, as the portfolio is further unwound. seven said given the volatility in markets it is practically impossible to reasonably forecast earnings for this current half ending december 2008 but it is likely that profit before tax including significant items will be approximately 40/50 pct below the prior corresponding period based on losses on the portfolio of $14 million as well as the weakness in advertising markets and the previously advised impact o profits from the acquisitions of unwired and engin, whose earnings are now consolidated in the seven group. the company hopes that market volatility will have reduced by the time of the agm on

is well positioned to generate strong returns to shareholders. he said there has been no loss of market share for both of its key generics and wholesale sales channels in the lead up to the introduction of price cuts under reforms to the pbs, although customers significantly reduced their inventory levels. the ceo reconfirmed full year guidance for reported net profit after tax in the

morgan stanley and goldman sachs, the last of the breed, have become regulated banks. length: 394 words the us federal reserve board has approved the applications requests of the two remaining investment banks on wall street, goldman sachs and moran stanley, to become commercial banks. the object is to bring about an improvement in the liquidity of the two banks, in view of the collapse in the value of their investments. the move qualifies the two banks for direct access to loans from the central bank, which will help to prop up their liquidity. morgan stanley and goldman sachs will now take upon themselves the restrictions and regulatory framework of other commercial banks in the us. the past week has seen the collapse of investment bank lehman brothers, and the sale of merrill lynch to bank of america for $50 billion. morgan stanley has been in talks with wachovia corp. over a takeover, after acknowledging that it would find it difficult to meet its commitments. from this point of view, the important difference between investment banks and commercial banks is that the latter can take deposits from retail customers rather than relying on borrowing from other banks as investment banks do, a model that leaves them vulnerable. goldman sachs chairman and ceo said lloyd blankfein said, \"when goldman sachs was a private partnership, we made the decision to become a public company, recognizing the need for permanent capital to meet the demands of scale. while accelerated by market sentiment, our decision to be regulated by the federal reserve is based on the recognition that such regulation provides its members with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and funding. \"we believe that goldman sachs, under federal reserve supervision, will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources.\" because of concerns about their liquidity, the share prices of morgan stanley and goldman sachs have fallen sharply over the past week, morgan stanley's by 27% and goldman sachs' by 16%. according to bloomberg, morgan stanley has written off $15.7 billion in the current financial crisis and goldman sachs about $4.9 billion, and while the two banks have remained profitable, their revenue has been in decline. published by globes [online], israel business news - www.globes.co.il - on september 22, 2008 \u00a9 copyright of globes publisher itonut (1983) ltd. 2008 load-date: september 22, 2008 language: english publication-type: newspaper copyright 2008 globes publisher itonut (1983) ltd. all rights reserved 521 of 998","the evening standard (london) september 22, 2008 monday c edition era ends as wall st big two lose status;
